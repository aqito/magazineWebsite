            Report: Large coursework

            My website aims to showcase fashion students portfolio to show to potential internships or buyers. The user can browse through different students work and should be able to contact them through information given on the site. I chose to implement a gallery structure that allows the user to scroll through images. 
            I gained inspiration from Pinterest, Instagram and Tumblr. 
            My site is accessible as I have made it responsive to a variety of devices such as computers, different types of browsers of varying ages, tablets and phones. Also I have made sure that the websites images display to an easily viewable size along with the text so users will not have a hard time viewing it on any device.
            During the creation of my website I had to learn by myself such as creating a scrollable gallery that at first I thought would require javascript to accomplish, but I found out later on it could be done with a combination of HTML and CSS. Also I had to find a suitable colour combination for my site that would not interfere with the colours that the clothing would show, this was hard as fashion students use a multitude of vibrant colours, I found that by first displaying the clothing in a greyscale manner and then allowing the user to see the colours when hovering above allowed the website to keep its 2 tone colour scheme. 
            I think that the gallery and minimalism aspect of my website worked best as it has a clean look that I aspired for. 
            I think if I had more time I would have added more to the contact us and about pages as it looks incomplete especially the contact us page. Also I would change the nav bar to not be fixed and I would have found a way to fade it out slowly as the page is scrolled down to gain a cleaner look.
